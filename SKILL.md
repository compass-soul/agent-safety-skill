description: Safety toolkit for autonomous AI agents. Pre-publish security scanning (API keys, tokens, PII, internal paths), git pre-commit hooks that block unsafe commits, and a health check script for system monitoring. Use when publishing to GitHub, committing code, or running periodic system health checks. Provides automated enforcement — not just prompts.

# Agent Safety

Automated safety tools for autonomous AI agents. The principle: **don't rely on prompts for safety — automate enforcement.**

All scripts are in this skill's `scripts/` directory. When OpenClaw loads this skill, resolve paths relative to this file's location.

## Pre-Publish Security Scan

Scans files for secrets, PII, and internal paths before publishing.

```bash
bash scripts/pre-publish-scan.sh <file-or-directory>
```

**Detects:**
- API keys (AWS, GitHub, Anthropic, OpenAI, generic patterns)
- Private keys (PEM blocks), Bearer tokens, hardcoded passwords
- Email addresses, phone numbers, SSNs, credit card patterns
- Physical addresses, name fields
- Home directory paths, internal config paths

**Exit 0** = clean. **Exit 1** = blocking issues found, do not publish.

## Git Pre-Commit Hook

Install once per repo. Automatically scans staged files on every commit:

```bash
bash scripts/install-hook.sh <repo-path>
```

- Scans staged content (what's being committed, not working tree)
- Blocks commit if secrets or SSNs found
- Flags PII for review
- Only bypassed with explicit `git commit --no-verify`

**Install this on every repo you work with.** It's the real guardrail.

## Health Check

System monitoring for disk, workspace, security, and updates:

```bash
bash scripts/health-check.sh
```

**Checks:** Disk usage, workspace size, memory file growth, OpenClaw version, macOS updates, firewall status, SIP status.

Run periodically (every few heartbeats). Watch for warnings.

## Rules

1. Run pre-publish scan before ANY external publish action
2. Install pre-commit hook on EVERY repo you work with
3. Blocking issues (secrets, SSNs) must be fixed — no override
4. Review items (emails, paths) need human judgment
5. If a secret was ever committed, it's compromised — rotate immediately
